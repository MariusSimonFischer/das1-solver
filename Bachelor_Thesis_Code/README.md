# DAS Scheduling
This repository implements three solving mechanisms for a DAS1 scheduling problem. Thereby, two heuristics (an adapted
Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, and Greedy Heuristic) and one MIP Solver (Gurobi) is used.
Federico Malucelli, Maddalena Nonato & Stefano Pallottino published the paper used as basis to this analysis [link to paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230372924_8).
